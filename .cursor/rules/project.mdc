# Project Rule

## Binding Frontend Documentation

For all frontend-related changes, the documentation in `docs/frontend/` is binding and must be followed:

- `docs/frontend/README.md`
- `docs/frontend/guidelines.md`
- `docs/frontend/components.md`

## Keep Frontend Documentation Up-to-Date

After any frontend change that introduces, renames, or removes a shared component, UI primitive, or styling pattern:

- Update `docs/frontend/components.md` if a reusable component was added, changed, or removed.
- Update `docs/frontend/guidelines.md` if a styling convention or interaction pattern changed.

Do this in the same changeset — never defer documentation updates.

## Required Behavior

- Always read `docs/frontend/` before creating new components or styling patterns.
- Reuse existing frontend components and established modal/form patterns.
- Keep styles and interaction patterns consistent with the documented guidelines.
- Avoid introducing new one-off styling where shared components already exist.
- When in doubt, check the existing UI primitives in `components/ui/` and domain components in `components/field/` before writing new code.
