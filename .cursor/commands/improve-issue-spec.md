Apply the **improve-issue-spec** skill.

- **Issue:** Use the issue number from my message (e.g. "Issue 3" or "#3"). If none given, ask which issue to improve.
- **Scope:** Only update the GitHub issue; no code, config, or other repo files.

**Workflow:** (1) Read and understand the issue. (2) Conceive fully (user story, acceptance criteria, open questions). (3) Ask me the conceptual questions in chat — do not save to GitHub yet. (4) After my answers: incorporate them and finalize the spec. (5) Save the finalized spec to the GitHub issue.

Run the workflow in `.cursor/skills/improve-issue-spec/SKILL.md` and confirm when the issue is updated.
